# cd <path>
By executing `cd`in the terminal you are simply switching from the current directory you are in to the one specifiied. In the first example I provide we switch the directoy from the home directory to lecture1.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
/home/lecture1
```
