I need some help with this lab, I made the script as said in the lab that is supposed to take github links and check if a certain file is contained and if it compiles correctly, but it seems like the file checking part isn't working. The github link I'm checking using my bash script is saying that the file isn't being found, but I know it should be finding it, here's what is happening in the terminal.

```
$ bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3
Finished cloning
File ListExamples.java not found
```
